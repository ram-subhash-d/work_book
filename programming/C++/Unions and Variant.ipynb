    "## Unions and Variant\n",
    "Union is a compond data structure where each member must have a distinct type. All the members are stored at the same address and only one member can be in use at a time. The main application of unions is if you are processing data which could be one of several types. It can be used to return values, if the outcome can be of different types. It can also be used for error handling, result object if successful else error code. All the members of a union are public by default, same as struct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problems in unions come with not knowing the currently used type, so a concept called tagged union to identify the currently used type using a struct is used.\n",

    "This still requires the programmer to set the type when setting the value and check the type when getting the value. The C++ way of fixing this is a wrapped union. Which is a class where the tagged union is a private member and the class has public member functions to access the union. These member functions make sure that tagged member is set and checked correctly and enforce the correct use of the union.\n",
