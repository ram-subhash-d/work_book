    "There are many programs that are written in C that we may want to use from our C++ programs. Examples are operating system API, database API's are usually written in C, third party librabies and frameworks written in C. C is a subset of C++, so C programs are legal C++ programs. The simplest solution is to compile the entire source code(C and C++ code) with a C++ compiler. This may not always be possible as the C source code might not be available. So we should interface with C at the binary level."

    "In order to interface a C++ program with a C library(static/dynamic) or vice versa, both the C and C++ compilers used must be compatible(normally we use same compiler for C and C++ for the same processor/OS). The final link step must be done with the C++ compiler. In C, a function has the same name in the binary object file. The C++ compiler mangles the names as it supports function overloading. If we want to use a C++ binary in a C program or include a C header in a C++ program, then we use the extern \"C\" directive. This will tell the C++ compiler not to mangle the function name.\n",
