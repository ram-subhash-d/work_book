    "In synchronous programming, when a task starts another task the current task is blocked, it must wait until the new task completes before it can continue. This reduces throughput and user satisfaction. With asynchrovous programming when we start another task, the current task can continue, the new task can run in the background. With this the current task can continue other work, provided it does not need the data from the asynchronous task, this increases the throughtput. Blocking is undesirable even in multi-threaded programs, asynchronous programming reduces the need to block. Synchronization in synchronous programming is achieved with mutexes and atomic operations. Synchronization in asynchronous programming is achieved with message queues. Threads which want thier tasks to be processed, push the tasks into the message queue and continue, another thread monitors the queue and processes the tasks. Asynchronous programming is used for parallel programming, start new threads which all perform the same task, collect the result from each thread as it completes its task and combine the results into the final answer."

    "## Choosing a thread object\n",
    "We have 3 ways to execute a task std::thread object, std::packaged_task object and std::async.\n",
    "* std::async() is the simplest way to execute a task, as it is a higher level abstraction on std::thread, the library manages the threads for the programmer, there is no need to use shared data. This also means that we don't have finer control of the inner std::thread object.\n",
    "* std::packaged_task is the best choice when we want to represent tasks as objects. It is a lower level abstraction than std::async() hence we have more control on the task and on which thread to execute.\n",
    "* std::thread is the most flexible. It allows to access the underlying thread implementation on the operating system. This allows to do things like setting thread priority, pin the thread to a particular core, these kinds of things are not possible on the other two."
