    "## Run-time Type Information\n",
    "This is related to type information about objects at run time. There are 3 main features, typeid, type_info and dynamic_cast. std::typeid() returns information about the dynamic type of its argument, it is mainly used in comparisions.\n",

    "else\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "When we call the std::typeid() it returns the std::type_info object. It has a name() member function which returns a c style string, unique for each type. It also has a hash_code() member function which returns a unique number for each dynamic type.\n",
    "```\n",
    "circle d;\n",
    "shape *pshape = &d;\n",
    "\n",
    "const std::typeinfo &tshape = std::typeid(*pshape);\n",

    "std::cout << tshape.hash_code() << std::endl;\n",
    "```\n",
    "We can use std::dynamic to convert a pointer of a base class to a pointer of the derived class(base pointer should have the derived object). It also applies to references. If the convertion fails it returns nullptr for pointers, for references std::bad_cast expection will be thrown.\n",

    "## Mutiple Inheritance\n",

    "## Virtual Inheritance\n",
    "It is possible for 2 parents in multiple inheritance to have the same base class. Here the final derived class inherits twice from the same base class, hence 2 base class objects will be created when we create an object of the final derived class. This is not desirable. The way to solve this is to use virtual inheritance.\n",
