    "## Overview\n",
    "In compile time programming, the compiler executes code at compile time. This result of the computation is available for the program at runtime. There will be no run time overhead, hence results in faster execution of the program. Compile time programming could be done in C using preprocessor(first stage of compilation) macro functions. We can give directives to the preprocessor, which start with a # symbol. For macro functions we use the #define directive, which defines a symbol and the preprocessor will replace that symbol by what ever you define it as. You can provide arguments too, the arguments will be substituted.\n",

    "MAX(++a, b); //Will be replaced with ((++a) > (b) ? (++a) : (b)) during preprocessing\n",
    "             //a may be increamented twice(if a++ > b)\n",
    "```\n",
    "There are a few problems with this, there is no type safety as it preprocessing, we should always put brakets around the arguments due to the operator precedence rules and if any of the arguments have side effects then they may be evaluated more than once(like a++ above).\n",
    "\n",
    "C++ has templates, these were intended to support generic programming. Meaning with templates we can write code to work with a generic type, then the compiler will generate code for the provided type. \n",
    "\n",
    "Later on it was discovered that templates provide a turing complete programming language(we can solve any problem using templates in theory).\n",
    "* We can use template parameters to represent state variables\n",
    "* We can use recursive instantiation to simulate loops\n",
    "* We can use template specialization to implement control flow\n",
    "* We can also use integer operations to calculate results(to do math)\n",
    "\n",
    "Template meta programming can be used for\n",
    "* Compile-time programming as stated above\n",
    "* It can be used for the original intended purpose, writing generic code to avoid duplication(e.g STL)\n",
    "* We can use it to make decisions at compile time for efficiency/portability(write code to generate code based on harware)\n",
    "* Develop a domian-specific language on top of C++\n",
    "* Express complex software patterns and concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Template classes have a convention, members that represent numeric results are named 'value' and members that represent types are named 'type'. C++ has type traits to get information about the properties of types. For example if we want to know if the template type is a arthematic type then we can use is_arithmatic\\<T\\>.\n",

    "constexpr functions must be pure, meaning it cannot modify its arguments and connot modify global/static variables. constexpr functions are inline, the function calls are emitted with the function code. Inline also means it can have multiple definitions, we can define it directly header and include it where ever required(like inline static member variables). A constexpr function can be called with arguments that are not constant expressions, it this case the function will be evaluated at runtime like normal C++ function. This will allow as not to write 2 identical versions of the same function. The body of a constexpr function should not contain code which causes a action at runtime, like new/delete(we cannot use things like std::string and std::vector), calling virtual functions, throwing exceptions etc. Member functions can also be constexpr, member variables can also be constexpr provided they are static."

If it is a function template the full function body goes into the header, for class template the full class definition goes into the header(no .cpp file). The reason for this is when we use the template in a source code file, the compiler should see the full definition of the template to generate and intantiate it for the specified type.
