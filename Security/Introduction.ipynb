The 5 layers of TCP/IP are\n",
    "  * Application: Interact with the user, run applications\n",
    "  * Transport: Deliver data from application to application, example from source skype to desitnation skype\n",
    "  * Network: Route data from computer to computer, uses routing, ip adresses etc.\n",
    "  * Link: Transfer the data over one link, individual jump from one divice to the next in the route\n",
    "  * Physical: Converts the bits to electromagnetic signals to transmit over wire or wireless medium\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "* While sending data each layer will consider what it received from the previous layer as data and add its header which in turn is passed to the next lower layer as data. The reverse happens on receiving the data, each layer extracts its header do the necessary processing and pass the remainder of the packet to the higher layer.\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "* Protocol Stack : There are lots of protocols which reside at different layers of the stack, and we have the flexibility to use any combination we want. For example HTTP, SMTP, FTP are application layer protocols. TCP, UDP are transport layer protocols. IP, ICMP are network layer protocols. Wi-Fi, Wired are link layer protocols.\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "* Application Layer : Most popular protocol is Hyper Text Transfer Protocol(HTTP), used for fetching HTML file/objects. It uses the reliable TCP protocol on the transport layer, if there is a packet loss TCP will resend the request and make sure that the object is retrived always.\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "* Transport Layer : Most popular protocol is Transmission Control Protocol(TCP), used by HTTP, FTP and SMTP. TCP is reliable, each packet is acknowledged, if the acknowledge is not recieved then the packet is resend. It also ensures ordered delivery, TCP is responsible for re-ordering packets at the destination before sending it to the application layer. It can tolerate delay but not loss. The second major protocol is User Datagram Protocol(UDP), widely used in multimedia. It is connectionless, unreliable and unordered. However this is ideal for multimedia communication, one frame lost in a vedio would not make a difference at the destination. Data transfer is very quick. Video streaming, audio calls and live streaming use UDP.\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "* Socket ports are on the transport layer. Each application uses a unique port. Socket = IP Address + Port. Port is a 16 bit number, so around 65,536 ports possible on a system. First 1024 are reserved ports(example HTTP is on 80), remaining are unreserved for other applications.\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "* Domain Name System(DNS) : It converts names to IP addresses. Uses UDP to avoid the TCP overhead. DNS is a server hierarchy that is distributed accross the world. The first level is root DNS servers, there are 13 of them around the world, they have the list of the top level domain servers. These domain servers are at level 2, they cater to a specific domain like .com. At the third level we have authoritative servers(owned by specific organigations), which have the specific ip's for their domains for example google.com.\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "* Network Layer : Network layer is responsible for routing the packets from source to the destination. This layer contains IP address which is used to route packets over networks to the destination. It always uses Internet Protocol(IP). Routers use dynamic routing algorithms(based on traffic) to create routing tables based on IP addresses to route the packet to the next router/device. IP addresses are 4 bytes long. IP is designed to be fast, hence it is a connection less protocol. No retransmissions at this layer. Packets can take mutiple routes based on traffic, hence packets can arrive unordered. IP always sends the packets over the best possible route. IP address can be public, reachable anywhere in the world. Private IP adresses are used with in organization, and can not be used for public communication. Private IP addesses have the ranges 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255, 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255 or 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255. For example if we configure a wireless router at home we see address like 192.168.1.1 on our device, this is a private IP address, the router will have a public IP address which will be facing the internet. There are also IP multicast adresses in the range 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255, used to send live streams simultaneously across the world. There is second protocol at this layer called Internet Control Message Protocol(ICMP). IP is used for routing where as ICMP is used for error reporting. ICMP is used in Ping and Traceroute applications. If a packet is lost in the network, an ICMP message will be sent to the source informing this error.\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "* Link Layer : This layer performs the hop to hop delivery, it takes the packet over 1 link to the next system. Network layer depends on the link layer for each individual hop of the end to end route. This layer has the Mac Address(Physical Address). The link header is changed on every hop, as MAC Addresses change. IP Addresses remain static for the entire route.\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "* Devices : Desktops, laptops and mobile phones implement all 5 layers, they are targeted for application to application communication. Routers only implement the network, link and physical layers. Switches only implement the link and physical layers, ment only to deliver over one link. \n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "* Network Address Translation : It is used on network gateways. It alows to use a single public IP address to handle thousands of internal systems, like in corporates where all systems are connected to the internet through one gateway. This enhances security too as internal IP addresses are hidden. NAT has a table to map internal IP and port to NAT gateway IP and a randomly generated port, it changes the source IP address and port to these and sends over the network. So the destination thinks that the packet is comming from the NAT gateway, so it sends the response to NAT gateway. NAT will use the table and send it to the internal system.\n",

Transport mode is mostly used for host to host communication, as IP header is not encrypted it allows end to end routing. Tunnel mode is mostly used for gateway to gateway communication, as the IP header is also encrypted here a new IP header is added with the gateway of the corporate network as the destination. The gateway has to extract the inner IP header and route it to the actual destination.\n",

If a long password is used from a large character set then it is difficult to break the passowrd by brute force. Passwords should never be stored, they are always hased and the hash is stored. Hence on one can recover the password from hash, as hash is one way. When the user enters the password, it is hashed and compared with the stored hash. Hackers use rainbow tables, which have all hashes pre computed for all possible passwords. To counter rainbow tables we can encrypt databases or use 'salt', a random number added to the password before hashing and storing it in the database, making rainbow tables ineffective.\n",

Examples - crashing web/database servers, overloading servers through bogus requests, choke the network through bogus traffic(send continuous ping messages). DoS attack comes from one IP address, hence it is easy to detect and block that source.\n",
    "    * DDoS : It is an attack from multiple IP addresses and harder to block, since it is difficult to differenciate between legitimate and froud users. Normally they hack a number of systems on the internet install bots through malware on them to create botnets and then do a DDoS attack on the target. They can have 1000's of bots in the botnetwork.\n",
    "    * Prevention : Load balancing, increase the number of servers and distribute the load. Identify attack patterns using machine learning techniques to identify abnormal behaviour and block. IP backlisting, check reputation of suspicious IP's and block using firewall. Blacklisting is not a one time fix as IP addresses keep changing. Cloud-based Content Distribution Networks(CDNS), this is third party service offered by companies like Cloud-Flare, here the traffic goes to the CDNS network before it is redirected to the corporate network. CDNS networks use the above mentioned techniques to block DDoS attacks.\n",

    "     * Ransomeware attack : It is a malware that encrypts your confidential data, then the hackers demand a ransom for decryption.\n",
    "     * Attack channel : Your system can become part of a botnet by installing malware on it. \n",
    "     * Malware types : Viruses, Worms, Rootkits, Trojans, Logic Bombs, Keyloggers, Spyware, Ransomware etc.\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "* Viruses and Worms : Virus infects applications and files by inserting itself into them. On running the infected appplication/file the virus becomes active. Virus has 2 main functions. Replication, it reporduces itself exponentially. If you open a virus infected file it may create hunderds of such files. Destruction by corrupting data, files and applications. Viruses are used to steal data, launch ransomware and DoS attacks or to jusy annoy. Virus types\n",
    "    * Boot Sector Virus : Infects the boot sector so that virus is always loaded. Easy to detect and remove.\n",
    "    * Macro Virus : This virus infects macros(scripts) in Microsoft office and spreadsheets. Damage potential is limited as macros require user permissions.\n",
    "    * Stealth Virus : Hides itself from anti-virus software by renaming itself, moving around the disk or by changing OS processes to evade detection.\n",
    "    * Polymorphic Virus : Modifies its own code dynamically to evade detection from anti-malware.\n",
    "    * Encrypted Virus : Encrypts itself to evade detection from anti-malware.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Unlike viruses, worms are auto triggered to replicate and propagate independently. Thier main attack vector is network propogation to bing down networks and multiple systems.\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "* Trojans : It is a malware that looks like legitimate software to trick users. Most commonly they are spread through phishing. Trojans can perform keylogging, screen recordings, modify data, disrupt system performance etc.\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "* Spyware and Adware : Spyware collects information from your PC without consent like browsing habits, credentails and screenshots. Adware bombards user with unwanted ads (popups, banners). To protect from spyware and adware, disable browser extensions and reset browser regularly.\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "* Logic Bombs and Rootkits : Logic bombs are bits of malicious code that disrupts programs and are triggered on a specific events. Event could be time/date based, logical(e.g. Number of users pass the 1000 mark) etc. They are typical injected by disgruntled employees. They are difficult to be detected as the footprint is small. Rootkits are a kind of a malware which embedded themselfs deep inside the system(e.g. in the operating system), they are hidden and allow hackers privileged access to the system. These are difficult to detect. Anomalies in behavioral patterns and memory dump analysis are used for detection. Removal often requires a complete rebuild of the system.\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "* Anti Malware/Anti Virus: Software that is meant to identify, detect and remove malware. There are 2 types of scans On-Demand and Real-time. For On-Demand user specifies when to do the scan, he can also specify which folders/files to scan. In Real-time scan the anti malware is always running in the back ground, and when ever you open a file or execute the anti malware intercepts and scans for malware. There are 2 types of malware detection techniques\n",
    "    * Signature based : Here malware is detected based on patterns. Every malware performs some specific tasks like infecting a perticular segment of the memory, access specific files in your operating system or modify certain registy entries. Based on these patterns signatures are defined and the anti malware detects the malware. There are also online sources where these signatures are defined for well known malwares. Limitation is that it cannot detect if the virus is unknown, a polymorpohic or a different strain.\n",
    "    * Anomaly based : It creates a base line of the normal behaviour of the system, like what operating systems files are usally running, which sevices are running, which registry segments are modified, which ports are open etc. Any behaviour which deviates from this base line is detected as malware. Works well with unknow viruses. A good solution is to combine both signature and anomaly-based detection."
