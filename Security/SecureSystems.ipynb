    "Object files start with the ELF header which describes the file organization, followed by different sections for code, data, symbols etc. At the end it has a section header table, which will help to locate the various sections.\n",

Machine type, for which processor this file is compiled for. Entry, virtual address where program begins execution(for executables). It also has a pointer to the section header table and the number of sections.\n",

    "## Buffer Overflows\n",
    "Buffer overflows can be in the stack, in the heap or it can be a return-to-libc attack. If we try to access memory outside the allocated size then it is called a buffer overflow, for example with char buffer\\[10\\], if we try to access buffer\\[10\\] then it is a buffer overflow, this will return the value at location after buffer in the stack(which could be anything on the program stack, other variables, frame pointer, return address etc.). Using buffer overflow an attacker can modify return address to point to his attack code, which will run his code when the current function returns. Normally the attacker will fill the buffer with his attack code, and then use buffer overflow to modify current stack frame return address to point to his code. This is known as the buffer overflow attack. The attacker must fill the buffer with the machine code of his attack code, they use tools like obejctdump to get the machine code. For example the below code can be used for buffer overflow attack, as strcpy tries to copy till it see's a NULL('\\0') character and the program is trying to copy a bigger array into a smaller one.\n",

    "* Canaries : It is a compiler defence mechanism. When ever a stack frame gets created(for a function) the compiler would insert a canary in the stack after the frame pointer by adding additional instructions. Canary is a random number, if this number is modified then the compiler would throw stack overflow error at the time of returning from the function(additional instructions inserted for this check), thus preventing buffer overflow attacks. For GCC we have to use -fstack-protector compiler option to enable canaries.\n",
    "* Non executable stack : This is implemented in the hardware, processor. This is implemented with a W^X bit(write exclusive or execute), when this bit is enabled for a segment(for example say the stack segment) then one can either write to that segment or execute from that segment, we cannot do both. The stack segment W^X bit is set, thus preventing buffer overflow attacks. Both Intel and AMD processors support this bit. Very effective as it is done by hardware and uses only a single bit per segment, but there are legitimate cases to execute code from stack, like the java just-in-time runtime, which generates code at runtime in stack and runs it. This is not possible with this bit."

These attacks are highly dependent upon knowing where these functions reside in memory, assumes that many systems use the same address mapping, therefore one attack may spread easily. ASLR randomizes the address space layout of the process, each process execution would have a different memory map(randomize the location of libraries, heap, stack, etc for each run of the application), thus making it difficult for the attacker to run exploits. There are 2 well known techniques to implement ALSR, load time relocatable and position independent executable/programmable independent code.\n",

This means the compiled code can only have place holders for addresses, these palce holders will be filled in during load time using relocatable tables(present in compiled libraries and executable). Limitations are that it has slower load time, it needs writable code segment which could pose security problems and each program needs a customised copy of a shared library instead of using the same copy of the shared library.  \n",

Normally the format string will have the format specifiers(like %d(int), %x(hexa decimal), %s(string)), format specifiers will be replaced with the arguments when forming the resulting string. One of the vulnerability of format string is insufficient arguments, example printf(\"%d %d %d\\n\", a, b), 3 format specifiers but only 2 arguments. In this case the value in location above b in the stack is printed for the 3rd format specifier. printf(\"%s%s%s%s%s%s\"), may crash as this would try to get strings from arbitary locations present in the satck as there are no arguments to printf.

'\\xc0 \\x96 \\x04 \\x08' is the address for the string s. printf works using 2 pointers, printer p points to the format specifiers in the stack and pointer ap which points to the arguments in the stack. %x's are added to the format string so that ap points to '\\xc0 \\x96 \\x04 \\x08' in the stack when %s format is being resolved by printf, this way the attacker can get the secret message.  \n",
    "printf also has format specifiers that can change a value at a memory location, not just read. For example printf(\"12345%n\", &i), the %n format specifier here would return the number of characters printed so far and load it to i. Using the same technique above to read any memory location, we can use the %n format specifier to write to any desired memory location with the number of bytes that printf has printed so far."

    "## Heap exploits\n",
    "Heap is a pool of memory present in the processes address space where dynamically alocated memory resides. Stack is fast, managed by compiler and used for temporary data, on the other hand heap is slow, manually managed by user and used for persistent data(across function calls). There are several different types of implementation/algorithms for heap management with the functions malloc/new and free/delete. These algorithms have to do a trade of between speed of memory management and memory fragmentation. Some of the famous implementations are ptmalloc2/ptmalloc3 from glibc, tcmalloc from google and jemalloc from android. Internally malloc/new uses brk and mmap syscalls to obtain memory from the OS for that process, a program will start with a heap size of 0, memory is allocated dynamically as new calls to malloc/new are made. The heap memory is structured as arena's, heaps and chunks. Arena is the full area, one arena per thread, each arena can have multiple heaps. Heap is the amount of memory allocated into arena by a single call to brk(typically 132 KB) when there is not enough memory in the arena. Heap is split into chunks of different sizes depending on the programs malloc and free calls. Free calls will not remove heaps from the arena, they remain there to be used by the next malloc/ new calls. The arenas are linked on a linked list, heaps in a arena are also linked on a linked list, similarly chunks in a heap are linked on a linked list, hence heap is not a continuous memory. Chunks are of 2 types, free chunks and allocated chunks, on calling free/delete allocated chunk is converted to free chunk,free chunks are linked in a doubly linked list to easily find the right chunk for the next malloc/new. To improve performance there are multiple doubly linked list's for free chunks, each list for particular size range of the chunks called bins. During free, if the previous or the next chunck is free, it can coalesce these adjacent chunks and form a much larger free chunk, this way fragmentation is reduced.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Double free : Most double frees are not detected. The second free would add a second duplicate chunk into the free double linked list. If malloc after this uses one of these 2 chunks, then you would have the same chunk allocated and in the free linked list. This would allow to change the forward and backward pointers of the chunk in the free double linked list using the allocated chunk. By appropriately setting the forward and backward pointers we can force the attack code to execute.\n",

Who are the subjects(user/process/application), what are the objects(files/programs/sockets/hardware), access is the various operations(read/write/execute/share) subjects can perform on objects. Access control can be at various levels application, middleware, OS and hardware.\n",
    "* Hardware access control : It should have policies to protect OS from applications, ensure that one application cannot interfere with another application, prevent one application hogging the entire system. To achieve these 3 policies hardware has the mechanisms paging unit, privilege rings and interrupts. Paging unit isolates one application address space from another application address space, thus protecting one application from another. Privilege rings protect OS from applications. OS runs in ring 0 and applications run in ring 3. Applications running in ring 3 cannot access, read or write anything running in ring 0. Interrupts are used to prevent one application hogging the system, interrupts are used by the schedular to context switch thus preventing from one application running.  \n",
    "* OS access control : It should have policies so that only authenticated users can use the system, one user's files should be protected from other user's and fair allocation of resources without starvation. OS uses the machanisms user authentication, access controll for files/objects and scheduling to achieve these policies. OS access control is based on user(indentity) and access rules which state what requesters are allowed to do. These rules are set by the administrator.\n",
    "* Linux access control : Subjects are users, groups, root user and processes(gets the permissions and privileges of the user who creates it). Objects are files, directories, sockets, process, process memory, file descriptors and so on. All users and their passwords are stored in /etc/shadow, /etc/passwd has information about the user like uid, gid, home directory of that user etc. When the process starts setuid(user ID) and setgid(group ID) are used to set the user and group id to that process, then the process will have the permissions and privileges of that user and group. On login a shell process is executed with the logged in user, any child process started from this shell will execute with the same user and group. sudo/su can be used to elevate the privileges to the root user. Every object in linux has read, write and execute(R, W and X) permissions. There are also 3 different types of users associated with every object onwer, group(to which the onwer belogs to) and others. For each of these 3 users the object specifies R, W and X permissions.  \n",
    "The entire linux security checks are done when the user tries to the get the file descriptors(access control permissions are checked by the operating system), once the user/process has the file descriptor no other checks are done. There are 2 ways to get a file descriptor, open a file or get it from another process(from parent or through shared memory/sockets). This way a root user can open a file and send the desciptor to a normal user, so the normal user can read/write into that file without having permissions for that file.  \n",
    "Process is both subject and object in linux. When debugging ptrace system call will allow one process to observe and control the other(GDB will control the process you are debugging).  \n",
    "This form of access control based on users has some drawbacks, like we cannot control information flow and the root user can do anything. To address these problems a new access control based on information flow policies was introduced. Mandatory access control is a information flow policy access control, it has to be enabled to use it, default is the access control based on users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example linux commands  \n",
    "* id : Display all the ids related to the current user.  \n",
    "* passwd : Command used by the user to change his or her password.  \n",
    "* chown : Change the ownership of a file.  \n",
    "* chmod : Change the permissions of a file.  \n",
    "* chgrp : Change the group of a file.  "

    "## Confinement in applications\n",
    "How do you run an entire untrusted application(from the internet) or part of a application that is untrusted(module or library) in your systems. Possible solutions are to use air gapped systems(isolated system not connected to the network), virtual machines or containers. All these solutions require a seperate system, virtual machine or container to be setup.  \n",
    "One way to acheive confinement is to break the large application(run in a single process) into small modules. Run each of these module as a different process and use RPC to communicate between the modules. Therefore if a vulnerabilbity is exploited by a attacker in any one of these process modules, the attacker would gain access to only that particular module, thus we are able to contain the amount of damage. These modules should be designed with the principle of least privileges, each module is given minimum privileges only enough to carry out its job, narrow interfaces between subsystems that only allow necessary operations, and security management should be done outside the application(example by the OS).  \n",
    "The disadvatage with this architecture is that it is slow as RPC is slow and a lot of context switching is required for the different processes to communicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example linux commands  \n",
    "* chroot : define the root file system a process can see, we can give a seperate file system for that process.\n",
    "* setuid : set the uid of a process to confine what it can do."

    "## Software fault isolation\n",
    "In this architecture all the modules are run in a same process, but each module is run within a confined environment, thus removing performance overheads. Here process space is partitioned into logical domains, each domian has its own code area, data area and a unique id, code in one domain is not allowed to read/modify data in another domain, code in one domain cannot call code in another domain, it is restricted to its code and data. The only way one doamin can communicate with another domain is through a low cost cross-domain RPC interface not involving OS(no context switching).  \n",
    "To acheive this the process user space is divided into several different memory segments, the segments are aligned in a way such that within each segment the higher order bits of the memory addresses are the same, this higher order bits value will be the unique ID of that segment. When calling code or data from a segment the higher order bits are checked, if not same the call is not allowed. \n",
    "To achieve segmentation, at the time of loading a object file into a segment we pass through the entire object file and check that every branch/load/store instruction is into the same segment. If the check passes the object is loaded into the segment. For instructions where adresses cannot be resolved during load time, check is done during runtime.  \n",
    "The cross-domain RPC is implemented using jump table(present in the domain), call stub(seperate domain), return stub(seperate domain). For every legal RPC call there is a look up in the jump table, this invokes the call stub, then the call stub invokes the method in the second domain, the return would be passed through the return stub. There is also a seperate domain for system calls, so any system call would go through the stub to this system domian, which checks the permissions of the domian and performs the call."
