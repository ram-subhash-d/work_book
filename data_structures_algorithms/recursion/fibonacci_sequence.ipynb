    "A man put one pair of new born rabbits in a certain place. How many pairs of rabbits can be produced from that pair in a year, if the nature of these rabbits is such that every month, each pair bears a new pair which from the second month on becomes productive. The number of rabbits after each month will follow the fibonacci sequence - 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ..., it has the formula fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2). So the regression will have 2 base cases, fib(1) = 1 and fib(0) = 0.\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "int fib(int n)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    //Base cases\n",
    "    if(n == 1 || n == 0)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        return n;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    //Fibonacci computation\n",
    "    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2); \n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "If you draw the execution of fib(n) as a binary tree, as each node is divided into 2 sub problems of size n-1 and n-2. The left most branch of the tree will have the longest path with n nodes and right most barnch of the tree will have the shortest path with n/2 nodes, so it is not complete binary tree but the top half of the tree till n/2 levels it will be a complete binary tree. The time complexity will be equal to the number of nodes in the tree. The top half of the tree will have 1 + 2 + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>3</sup> + ... + 2<sup>n/2</sup> nodes = 2<sup>(n/2 + 1)</sup> ~ θ(2<sup>n/2</sup>) ~ θ((2<sup>1/2</sup>)<sup>n</sup>) ~ θ(1.4<sup>n</sup>). As we have only taken only the top half of the tree, the least complexity is θ(1.4<sup>n</sup>), therefore the overall time complexity is exponential.\n",
    "If we look at the entire execution tree, many nodes will have to calculte the fibonacci value for the same number following the same tree path, if we can calculate for a given number only once, save and reuse it, we can improve the time complexity to θ(n). This cacheing of the values of subproblems is known as memoization.  \n",
    "For memoization it is better to go from bottom to top(iterative), like calculate fib(1) and fib(2) and use those values for fib(3), instead of the top down approach that we used in the recursive program above. This approach of going from bottom to top(iterative) and using memoization is called dynamic programming, here we store the values of the smaller sub problems and use them to calculate values of larger problems. We are using extra space but doing very well on the time complexity.  \n",
    "For the Fibonacci sequence we can also take a different recursive strategy to improve the time complexity to θ(n). The way to do it is to make the series shorter and shoter by adding to the base case values.\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "int fib(int n, int b1, int b2)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    //Return when all elements are complete\n",
    "    if(n == 0)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        return b1;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    //Decrease the size of the problem, by chip away the first element in the series, updating the 2 bases\n",
    "    return fib(n - 1, b2, b1 + b2); \n",
    "}\n",

    "This can be used for any additive sequence, adding the previous 2 numbers."
