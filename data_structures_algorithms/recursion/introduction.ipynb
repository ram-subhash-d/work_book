    "Recursion is used to solve large problems that can be reduced to smaller problems of the same form but somewhat simpler to solve. We can use the same decomposition technique to divide the subproblems into even simpler once, until they become so simple that we can solve them without furthur subdivision.

Who inturn can volunteer 10 each to raise 1000 each. Raising 1000 does not need furthur subdivision it can be acheived by a single person. Pseudocode for this would be  \n",
