    "## Combinatorial Enumeration\n",
    "Given a set of n distinct objects we want to enumerate all possible 'combinatorial objects'. combinatorial objects can permutations(order matters) or combinations(order does not matter). Within permutations again repetition can be allowed or not allowed.\n",
    "As a first example let us try to enumerate all possible binary string of length 3. Here we are talking about permutations where repetition is allowed. A brute way of doing it is to use 3 for loops.\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "for(int i = 0; i < 2; i++)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    for(int j = 0; j < 2; j++)\n",

    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "But if the length of the binary string variable say n, the number of for loops change, which cannot be done dynamically. We can do it with a recursive strategy. The time complexity of these algorithms is at a minimum θ(n2<sup>n</sup>), as there will be 2<sup>n</sup> permutations with length n.\n",
    "To solve binary strings of size n, we have to visualize it as a tree, the first node can have 0 or 1 for the first location, the second level has 2 nodes, each of which can again be a 0 or a 1, if we do this recursively the left nodes will give all the permutations.  \n",
    "One way to do this is to first generate binary strings of size 1, from that list generate strings of size 2 and so on. This way if we get all possible permutations of size n - 1, we can make all possible permutations of size n, by taking each item and making 2 items from it, appending '0' and '1' each.\n",

    "But this algorithm can be improved on the space complexity, to avoid allocating 2<sup>n</sup> space just for the last iteration. Instead of doing work from bottom up(n = 1 to n), we do the work from top to bottom(n = n to 1). The root node will delegate all the binary strings starting with 0 to the left node and binary strings starting with 1 to the right node, this is done recursively by each node. This is like traversing the full tree and the leaf node paths give the permutations/combinations. This is the general approach that we can use for all permutations/combinations problems.\n",

    "So this is a depth first search algorithm, so the chain of recursive calls will be from the root to one leaf first, before it comes back and traverses to the second leaf, so the maximum amount of space we will be using at any given time is the height of the tree, so space complexity is θ(n) for this algorithm. The previous algorithm was a breath first search algorithm, here the space complexity will be the number of leaf nodes, which is θ(2<sup>n</sup>).BFS is a decrease and conquer algorithm where as DFS is a divide and conquer algorithm."

    "The amount of work that needs to be done by a internal node, is proportional to the number of choices it has to make at its level. For example for the root node work is proportional to n, for level 1 each node's work is proportional to n-1 so proportional to n(n-1). At the leaf level there are n! nodes and each one printing a string of size n, so time complexity is n * n! only for the leaf nodes. Even if we ignore all the internal nodes work as they are less when compared to n * n!, this a exponential time algorithm. As it is a DFS algorithm the space complexity is θ(n)."
