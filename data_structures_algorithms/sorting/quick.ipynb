    "Quick sort is a divide and concur algorithm. In merge sort most of the work was done in the combine step, divide and solve where trivial steps. In quick sort most of the work will be done in the divide step, the other two will be trivial. In the divide step we pick a pivot(value at any arbitary index), sort the pivot to the right location by moving elements smaller than it to before it and moving elements bigger than it to after it. Once this is done the array is partitioned on the pivot (excluding the pivot) then the left partition is given to the left child and the right partition to the right child of the tree.The above process is repeated for each partition till all the elements are done.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The naive way to sort and do the partition around the pivot is to create a auxilary array of the same size, pick a pivot, scan the remaining elements, insert values less than the pivot to the left of the auxilary array, values greater than pivot to the right and the remaining spot at the end for the pivot, finally copy the auxilary array back to the original array.  \n",
    "A more efficient way will be to do in place partion, to do this we can pick a pivot and rearrange the remaining elements to get the left partion elements first, followed by the right partition elements. Then we can swap the pivot with the right most element of the left partion. So no etra space is used. This is Lomuto's partitioning algorithm."

    "Here the divide step to pick the pivot, scan the remaining elements, puting them into the left and right partions and copying the aux array back to original array, all this work time complexity is proportinal to n. Therefore T(n) = cn + T(left partition) + T(right partition). The size of the partions will depend on how close the pivot value is to the median. if we picked the median as pivot then T(n) = cn + 2T(n/2). If the split is even accross the tree then time complexity is θ(nlogn), which is the best case. In the worst case, if the pivot is always the smallest or the largest element, the split will be extremely skewed, only one side of the tree will get all the elements, no split. In this case T(n) = cn + T(n-1), if this happens accross the tree, then time complexity is θ(n<sup>2</sup>). The average case time is close to the best case time. Since the average case is same as the merge sort time and the constant terms are faster than merge sort we call it quick sort.\n",
