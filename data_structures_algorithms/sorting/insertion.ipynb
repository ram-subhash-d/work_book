    "## Insertion Sort\n",
    "Here we assume for the nth iteration, all the elements to the left have already been sorted. So in the nth iteration we insert the nth element into the correct position in the already sorted elements to the left. One way to insert the element to the correct position is to do repeated swaping till the element is placed in the correct position. But swapping takes 3 opearions and repeated swapping is expensive. A better way would be to keep the nth element in a temp variable and shift the elements in the sorted part to the right till we reach the correct position and then insert the temp varaible. Shift is single operation, hence performs better than swapping."

    "T(n) = $\\Sigma_{i=1}^{n}$ (Time spent to insert i). Time spent on the inner while loop for ith element will be equal to the number of shifts, which depends on the ith element value. Depending on the value, the number of shifts can be as high as i times or as low as 0 times. These are known as worst case and best case senarious respectively. If the array is reverse sorted then every iteration will be the worst case time(i times), on the other hand if the array is already sorted then every iteration will be the best case time(0 times), all other arrays come inbetween these 2 times. Average case will depend on how the input will come typically in production.  \n",
    "So for the best case the inner while loop will not take any time, the outer for loop will run for n times, hence T(n) = θ(n). In the worst case for each ith iteratrion inner while loop will run for i times, T(n) = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n-1, hence T(n) = θ(n<sup>2</sup>). For the average case, say that a typical input will need to shift i/2 times for the ith iteration, T(n) = (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n-1)/2, for this case T(n) will still remain the same, as the square term is still the dominent term, T(n) = θ(n<sup>2</sup>). Therefore Big-O for insertion sort is O(n<sup>2</sup>), Big-Omega of insertion sort is Ω(n).  \n",
    "For space complexity it uses the same array, no extra memory is needed, hence it is an in place algorithm, θ(1)."
