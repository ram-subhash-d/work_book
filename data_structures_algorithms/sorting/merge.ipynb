    "Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm. First we divide each partition into two partitions recursively until we have individual array elements as partitions, i.e we divide the big problem into smallest problems possible. Then we start merging upwards, by merging two already sorted partions at each level, we do this recursively upwards until the entire array is merged and sorted.  "

    "To calculate the running time of merge sort, imagine the partioning and merging as a tree. At each level of the tree, the running time will be n(number of nodes at that level * size of sub problem at that level). Say there are h levels, the last level will have n nodes(only one array item per node), so 2<sup>h</sup>=n, applying logs on both sides, h = log<sub>2</sub>(n). T(n) = running time at each level * number of levels, T(n) = nlog<sub>2</sub>(n), so θ(n) = nlogn. It is the same for best, worst and average case as merge sort does not depend on input data, therefore O(nlogn) and Ω(nlogn). O(nlogn) performs way better than O(n<sup>2</sup>), as logn is way less than n. \n",

    "For space complexity it needs an extra n size array, for the temporary auxilary array, so θ(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "Out in the real world sort functions, many times a combination of sorts is used, merge and insertion sort. When n is less, insertion sort is used, as for merge sort, the system dependent constant factors can be high for a small n, for inputs that are almost sort insertion sort is used, θ(n), for large n merge sort is used. Even within the merge sort, for combining the smaller partitions, insertion sort is used in these combined/hybrid sort algorithms."
